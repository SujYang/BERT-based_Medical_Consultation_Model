# Overview
The model architecture consists of two transformer-based models, BioMedLM and LinkBERT, which are fine-tuned and combined for downstream classification tasks. BioMedLM is a transformer model pre-trained on biomedical text data, while LinkBERT is specifically fine-tuned on PubMed articles.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
